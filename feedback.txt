To analyze the design and the code's output:

### 1. Distinct Objects Identified:
- Card Number (**** **** **** 3241)
- Text "Total Balance"
- Total Balance Amount ($214,453.00)
- Background color and border

### 2. Location Relative to Frame Boundaries:
#### Design (1st Image):
- **Card Number**: Top center
- **Total Balance Text**: Center beneath the card number
- **Total Balance Amount**: Center beneath the "Total Balance" text
- **Background**: Neon yellow with rounded border, filling most of the space

#### Codeâ€™s Output (2nd Image):
- **Card Number**: Top center
- **Total Balance Text**: Center beneath the card number
- **Total Balance Amount**: Center beneath the "Total Balance" text
- **Background**: Neon yellow with rounded border, larger footprint than the design

### 3. Size Comparisons:
- The text components (card number, balance text, and amount) are similar in both images.
- The background in the code's output is relatively larger compared to the design.

### 4. Spatial Relationships Between Objects:
- **Design**: Elements are evenly spaced and centered vertically, creating a compact look.
- **Code's Output**: Elements have similar spacing, but the surrounding space is larger, making the text elements appear smaller by comparison.

### 5. Recommendations for Fixing the Code's Output:
- **Background Size**: Reduce the height of the background to resemble the compact design.
- **Text and Element Spacing**: Ensure that the text elements are centered within the reduced background and maintain similar spacing to the design.
- **Border and Background**: Retain rounded borders and ensure that the background color matches.

By adjusting the background size and ensuring proper alignment and spacing, the code's output can more closely match the original design.
